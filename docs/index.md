## Description
Vampire Killer is an action-platformer game of the Castlevania series produced by [Konami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami) which was originally released in 1986 for the [MSX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) and later on in 2014 for [Wii U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U) and Microsoft [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows).

In this game you play Simon Belmont, a descendant of a legendary clan of vampire killers and the current bearer of the holy whip "Vampire Killer", who will have to advance through seven levels (divided in 18 stages) full of monsters and objects inside Dracula's Castle in Transylvania. After clearing puzzles to unlock the path and defeating monstuous bosses he will have a fierce battle against Dracula himself to vanquish him and put to an end his reign of terror.
